# About

Hello! My name is Billie-Mae and I have recently started up a small cake business. I am currently taking orders for mainly buttercream cakes, as well as cupcakes. However, feel free to message me with any queries or questions, or even try my ‘build a cake’ option on the website if you have an idea of what you may like already! I also have a useful ‘portfolio’ page on my website where you can
browse and read descriptions of recent cakes I have done, to help with ideas or look at something you may not have seen before!


I am based in Portsmouth, though I am happy to take orders from surrounding areas including Petersfield, Chichester, Southampton and many more!
