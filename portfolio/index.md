## Baileys Cake
![Baileys Cake](/assets/images/photos/BaileysCake/baileysCake1.jpeg)

This cake is a wonderful, rich, and indulgent number. Inside there are four layers of milk chocolate sponge, layered with milk chocolate buttercream and a final layer of Baileys buttercream for that extra flavour.

Covering the cake is a vanilla buttercream, with some Baileys buttercream rosettes acting as a border. I added white and milk chocolate drip for extra extravagance and flair. Then to decorate, there are some mini Baileys of different flavours as well as some Bueno bars and Twirls.

## Chocolate Lovers' Heaven

This chocolate cake consisted of four 6-inch cake layers of light, fluffy chocolate sponge, and each covered individually with a rich chocolate buttercream. The outside of this cake consists of a 50/50 vanilla and chocolate buttercream, to give the cake added visual flair. It's topped with a marbled buttercream swirl, Dairy Milk chocolates and, my favourite, milk chocolate Lindors.

## Rose Cupcakes

These cupcakes are delightful for summer months and celebrations! The buttercream roses and flowers look so pretty on these cupcakes, but they also taste amazing! This was my first attempt at these cupcakes, and I cannot wait to do more!

## Fondant Rose

These pink and white flowers are hand made from fondant, they work amazingly as a cupcake or cake topper! There are many different shapes and sizes possible, though this is still the start of my journey, so they are still not quite perfect!

## White Chcocolate Galore

This red velvet sponge is covered in a sweet white chocolate buttercream. It's totally tasty and it looks amazing too! I decided to add a white chocolate drip and some white chocolate goodies to really add the look of this cake!

## Marble Mayhem

This ‘Marble Mayhem’ cake consist of three layers of 7-inch marble sponge, covered with two layers of chocolate buttercream and a layer of a cookies and cream buttercream. The outer layer of this design consists of a marble buttercream, a marble chocolate drip and a marble buttercream swirl – making it Marble Mayhem! The Oreos and Twix chocolates were requested by my customer as these are their favourites!

## Under The Sea

This cake of many colours and sea swirls consists of 4 layers of 6-inch chocolate sponge! It's covered in vanilla buttercream, and handmade fondant seashells and mermaid tails. My customer also requested a personalised 'Happy Birthday' topper, which is seen in one of the photos above. This cake not only looks mystical, but the offcuts I can promise tasted out of this world.

## Devil's Red Velvet

This hearty, extra tall red velvet cake consisted of rich, moist red velvet sponge. Layered with rich white chocolate buttercream, as well as a chocolate drip which was also added to the top of the cake, for extra white chocolate! To add to that, is a white chocolate array of goodies - Kit Kats, white chocolate bars and milk chocolate buttons! This cake is not for the faint hearted!
