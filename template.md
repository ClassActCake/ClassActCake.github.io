# Page template

`layout` should be left as is, unless we add a different layout in the future

`title` is the page title, shown in the tab title

`showSiteTitle` is whether or not the site title is shown in the tab title, for example if set to true a page would be shown as being "Class Act Cake | About" rather than just "About"

`description` is the page description

`showDescription` currently does nothing other than help SEO

`hideFooter` can be used to hide the "go back" button at the bottom of each page
